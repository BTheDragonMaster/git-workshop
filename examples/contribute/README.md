# Contributing to a forked repository

In this exercise, you will help me finally get rid of that dog in the bisect-revert readme.

Before you begin, run two commands to return to the same state of main as exists on the remote repository, since you have probably made a bunch of changes.
I have not explained these commands, but if you're interested you can ask me.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git reset --hard origin/main
```

I will not give you too many commands below.
This is just a short fun exercise to show you how the GitHub way of working goes.

If you need help with anything, ask me during the workshop, but you probably know how to do these things:

1. Create a new branch called hotfix/annoying-dog
2. Change the message in examples/bisect-revert/README.md on lines 119, 120 and 121 to something you like
3. Commit this change
4. Push this branch to your remote repository using ```git push -u origin hotfix/annoying-dog```
5. Open a pull request from your branch on your github repository to the workshop repository

I will probably not accept it, but it's good to know how it works, anyway.
