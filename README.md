# git-workshop
Repository for the BIF GIT workshop

## Introduction

This is the repository used in the GIT workshop for the WUR Bioinformatics group.

This repository contains a number of examples relating to the workshop, but should stand on their own as well.

Each example is in its own directory under examples/. To work with an example, open the README.md in that example folder.

This set of examples works best if you have an IDE you can use to keep an eye on the README.md while you work in the command line.
