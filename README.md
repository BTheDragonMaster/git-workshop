# git-workshop
Repository for the BIF GIT workshop

## Introduction

This is the repository used in the GIT workshop for the WUR Bioinformatics group.

This repository contains a number of examples relating to the workshop, but should stand on their own as well.

Each example is in its own directory under examples/. To work with an example, open the README.md in that example folder.

Some examples may refer to other branches, and will ask you to check out those branches before you begin.
Once you check out that branch, the readme within the example folder will update.

## The basics

The main branch you are on is pretty basic, with a couple of example folders.
But we can still learn a thing or two from this.
